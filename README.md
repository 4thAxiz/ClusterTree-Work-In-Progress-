# ClusterTree-Work-In-Progress-
## Linearized Binary Spatial-Partitioning Structure (unlike traditional trees that have a O(n log n) overhead) for sub-linear queries (currently unbalanced)

### Caveats
- Tree is Unbalanced as of now.
- Static-tree, not intended as a dynamic structure yet.
  
Experimental, work in progress.
Research paper coming soon
